- Add activation functino to Node
- implement XOR experiment
- 


implement new reproduction function
	take 1 from each species
	then randomly select with weighted toward better species.
	Mating should occur within species and be again weighted towards performance (position in list)

add age dropoff
add evaluation dropout simulation
[DONE]
score each species
